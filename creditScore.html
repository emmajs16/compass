        <h1>What Is Credit Score?</h1>
        <h5><strong>Credit Score:</strong> is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the creditworthiness of an individual.</h5>
        <ul>
    </center>
            <li>Credit scores are very important if one wants to take out a loan, rent an apartment, buy a car, buy a phone, etc. </li>
            <li>A credit score is measured from 300 to 850, the higher the number the better.</li>
        </ul>
        <center>
        <h5>Unfortunately, when one immigrates to the United States of America, he or she must start out with a brand new credit score.</h5>

        <h1>Tips to Quickly Build Up One's Credit Score</h1>
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li>1. <strong>Start with one account.</strong> Start small and be targeted -- don't apply for 10 things at once. You might want to start out by going to a credit union or local bank and applying for a secured credit card -- one that is backed by funds you put in an account.</li>
            <li>2. <strong>Make it automatic.</strong> Consider setting up automatic payments through your bank to make absolutely sure all of your bills, from utilities to loans, get paid on time. That way, there's no chance of missing a deadline.</li>
            <li>3. <strong>Lean on your spouse.</strong> If you relocated for love and your spouse has good credit, you might be able to "piggyback" on their good credit by becoming an authorized user on a spouse's credit card or by jointly applying for a loan.</li>
            <li>4. <strong>Leverage a current credit card if you can.</strong> If you have a credit card in your home country from an international issuer, you might be able to call the financial institution and get them to issue you a U.S. credit card based on your past relationship.</li>
            <li>5. <strong>Try to make your rent count.</strong> If you find a place to rent and you pay that rent on time, you can try to get your rent payments reported to Experian, which now includes rent payments in credit reports. If your landlord does not already report to the bureau, you and your landlord can sign up for electronic rent payments, which will be automatically reported to Experian's <a href="http://www.experian.com/rentbureau/rental-payment.html">RentBureau</a>.</li>
            <li>6. <strong>Meet with a lender in person.</strong> It might make sense to go face-to-face to a bank and explain your situation instead of applying for a credit card or loan online. One suggestion: Print out a hard copy of your credit history from home and take it in with you to show the lender -- it may help.</li>
            <li>7. <strong>Network with other new arrivals.</strong> They may be able to provide names of car sales reps, real estate agents and other professionals who are flexible and willing to work with immigrants starting from zero.</li>
            <li>8. <strong>Consider alternative credit.</strong> Social lending is an option for immigrants building credit, though it's not available to everyone. The Mission Asset Fund works with nonprofits in six states and is hoping to double that number by next year.</li>
