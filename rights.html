           <li>You have the right to remain silent. If you wish to exercise that right, say so out loud.</li>
           <li>You have the right to refuse to consent to a search of yourself, your car or your home.</li>
           <li>If you are not under arrest, you have the right to calmly leave.</li>
           <li>You have the right to a lawyer if you are arrested. Ask for one immediately.</li>

       <h3 class="tax boldfont">What to Do If Immigration Agents (ICE) Are at Your Door</h3>
       <h4 class="tax normalfont">Know your rights and remain calm.</h4>
     </center>
       <ul class="tax normalfont">
           <li>If officers are at your door, keep the door closed and ask if they are Immigration agents, or from ICE.</li>
           <li>Ask the agents what they are there for.</li>
           <li>Opening the door does not give the agents permission to come inside, but it is safer to speak to ICE through the door.</li>
           <li>If the agents don't speak your language, ask for an interpreter.</li>
           <li>If agents want to enter, ask them if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, you may refuse to open the door or let them in. An administrative warrant of removal from immigration authorities is NOT enough.</li>
           <li>If they say they have a warrant, ask them to slip the warrant under the door.</li>
           <li>Look at the top and at the signature line to see if it was issued by a court and signed by a judge. Only a court/judge warrant is enough for entry into your premises. One issued by DHS or ICE and signed by a DHS or ICE employee is not.</li>
           <li>Do not open your door unless ICE shows you a judicial search or arrest warrant naming a person in your residence and/or areas to be searched at your address.</li>
           <li>In all other cases, keep the door closed. State: 'I do not consent to your entry.'</li>
           <li>If agents force their way in anyway, do not attempt to resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: <strong>'I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.'</strong> </li>
